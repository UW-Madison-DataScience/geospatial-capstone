### How we got the capstone data:

The capstone project uses data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS).
[Click here to visit the NRCS Geospatial Data Gateway](https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov/GDGOrder.aspx?order=QuickState).

The gateway guides you through 5 steps to request data:

1. Where
2. What
3. How
4. Who
5. Review

On the **WHERE** tab, select Wisconsin from the dropdown.

If you are asked to select counties,
change the method for selecting the order area to `Order by State` by 
clicking the link just below the word WHERE.

Click `CONTINUE`.

On the **WHAT** tab, find the *Climate Precipitation* section and check the box next to
`1971-2000 Annual Average Precipitation by State`.

Next, find the *Climate Temperature* section and check the box next to
`1971-2000 Annual Average Maximum Temperature by State`.

Click `CONTINUE`.

On the **HOW** tab, select `ESRI Shape` from the dropdown in the *format* section.
Next, select `Geographic WGS84` from the dropdown in the *projection* section.

Click `CONTINUE`.

On the **WHO** tab, enter your e-mail address. This is how the data will be delivered to you.

Click `CONTINUE`.

The **REVIEW** tab will allow you to review your order.

Click `PLACE ORDER`.

The data should be delivered to your inbox in about 5 minutes or less.
Download the files by clicking the links in the e-mail.

The data will download as a  compressed `.zip` file. 
Expand/unzip this file and
move the contents into the data directory of your GeospatialCarp project.
