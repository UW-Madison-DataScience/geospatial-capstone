teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What format should I use to represent my data?"
- "What are the main data types used for representing geospatial data?"
- "What are the main attributes of raster and vector data?"
objectives:
- "Describe the difference between raster and vector data."
- "Describe the stregnths and weaknesses of storing data in raster vs. vector formats."
- "Distinguish between continuous and categorical raster data, and identify types of datasets that would be stored in each format."
- "Describe the three types of vectors and identify types of data that would be stored in each."
keypoints:
- "Raster data is pixelated data where each pixel is associated with a specific location."
- "Raster data always has an extent and a resolution."
- "The extent is the geographical area covered by a raster."
- "The resolution is the area covered by each pixel of a raster."
- "Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earth's surface along with attributes of those features."
- "Vector objects are either points, lines, or polygons."
