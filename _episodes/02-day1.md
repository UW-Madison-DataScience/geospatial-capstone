This episode reviews the two primary types of geospatial data: rasters and vectors. It will provide an overview of these two types of geospatial data, describing major features of both and providing examples of where you might find each type. 

# Data Structures: Raster and Vector

Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated with a specific geographic location. The value of a pixel can be continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use). This data structure is very common: it's how we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the raster's extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and its coordinate reference system (CRS). 

Some examples of continuous rasters include:

1. Precipitation maps
2. Maps of tree height derived from LiDAR data 
3. Elevation values for a region

Some rasters contain categorical data where each pixel represents a discrete class such as landcover type (e.g., "forest" or "grassland") rather than a continuous value such as elevation or temperature. Some examples of classified maps include:

1. Landcover/land use maps
2. Tree height maps classified as short, medium, and tall trees
3. Elevation maps classified as low, medium, and high elevation

> ## Advantages and Disadvantages
> 
> With your neighbor, brainstorm potential advantages and disadvantages of storing data in raster format.

> > Raster data has some important advantages:
> > 
> > * representation of continuous surfaces
> > * potentially very high levels of detail
> > * data is 'unweighted' across its extent - the geometry doesn't implicitly highlight features
> > * cell-by-cell calculations can be very fast and efficient
