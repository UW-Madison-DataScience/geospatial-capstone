This episode reviews the two primary types of geospatial data: rasters and vectors. It will provide an overview of these two types of geospatial data, describing major features of both and providing examples of where you might find each type. 

# Data Structures: Raster and Vector

Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated with a specific geographic location. The value of a pixel can be continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use). This data structure is very common: it's how we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the raster's extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and its coordinate reference system (CRS). 

Some examples of continuous rasters include:

1. Precipitation maps
2. Maps of tree height derived from LiDAR data 
3. Elevation values for a region

Some rasters contain categorical data where each pixel represents a discrete class such as landcover type (e.g., "forest" or "grassland") rather than a continuous value such as elevation or temperature. Some examples of classified maps include:

1. Landcover/land use maps
2. Tree height maps classified as short, medium, and tall trees
3. Elevation maps classified as low, medium, and high elevation

## Important Attributes of Raster Data

### Extent

The spatial extent is the geographic area that the raster data covers. The spatial extent of an R spatial object represents the geographic edge or location that is the furthest north, south, east, and west. In other words, extent represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object. 

### Resolution

A resolution of a raster represents the area on the ground that each pixel of the raster covers.

## Raster Data Format for this Capstone

Raster data can come in many different formats. For this capstone, we've offered data in the GeoTIFF format, which has the extension `.tif`. A `.tif` file stores metadata or attributes about the file as embedded `.tif tags`. For instance, your camera might store a tag that describes the make and model of the camera or the date that the photo was taken when it saves a `.tif`. A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` image format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file as tags. These tags should include the following raster metadata:

1. Extent
2. Resolution
3. Coordinate Refernce System (CRS) - you'll explore this concept in a later episode. 
4. Values that represent missing data (`NoDataValue`).
