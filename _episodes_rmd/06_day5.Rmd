- Addressing Minute questions (10-15 min)
- Use csv to add in points for each county (we would need to create these points ahead) - these points could be precipitation collection spots, weather forecasting locations, centroids?, major cities?

- Using last question to also talk about pros/cons of raster vector data with answering questions like these
- Wrap up (10-15 min)
