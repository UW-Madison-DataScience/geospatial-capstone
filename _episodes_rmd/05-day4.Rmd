title: 'Day 4: Exploring Vector Data'
output: html_document
objectives:
- "Importing vector data; exploring vector data through attributes and by plotting"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
##source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
##knitr_fig_path("05-")
```

## Load libraries
```{r, echo=solutions, include=solutions}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(rgdal)
```

## Load in and explore Wisconsin Precipitation, and Counties
In this exercise, you will work with two vector data files: Wisconsin Annual Precipitation Average 1981-2010, and county outlines. 
```{r, echo=solutions, include=solutions}
wi_precip <- st_read("../data/precipitation/precip1981_2010_a_wi.shp")
wi_county <- st_read("../data/WI_CensusCBF_Counties_2010/WI_CensusCBF_Counties_2010.shp")
## County data is from here https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/4E677AF3-3FF2-43FA-8A58-3C345EC7F465
```

Explore the data> identify the geometry type, projection, 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
