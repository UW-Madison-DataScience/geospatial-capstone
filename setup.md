## Overview

This page will guide you through the setup for the Geospatial Data Carpentry workshop capstone
project.

> ## Prerequisite
>
> Software and packages used in this capstone are installed for the main workshop.
> Visit the [Setup Page](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/geospatial-workshop/setup.html) of
> the [full workshop website](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/geospatial-workshop/) to install the necessary
> software before continuing.

## Set up a new project to store capstone code and data

The main workshop has you create a project called GeospatialCarp.
For the capstone, you will create a second project called GeospatialCapstone.

Open RStudio. Click File and then New Project.

Next click New Directory and then New Project.

Name the directory GeospatialCapstone and save it to your desktop or another convenient location.

Move the data folder you downloaded as part of the setup into the Geospatial Capstone direcotry.

## Data

You can follow along with the capstone project using the capstone data provided or
using your own data you obtained elsewhere.

Capstone data includes climate data to complement the environmental data used in the main workshop.
If you use your own data, there are some criteria to
help you succeed in completing the learning objectives.

You can download the capstone data by clicking [this download link](FIXME).
The file approximately 2MB.

The data will download as a single compressed `.zip` file.
Expand/unzip this file so that the data folder is within your `capstone` directory.

For a full description of the data used in this workshop see the [data page](FIXME).

Other data used in the capstone project will be downloaded using R scripts.
This data includes the BIOCLIM dataset.

You can read more about the BIOCLIM dataset
[here](https://rdrr.io/cran/dismo/man/bioclim.html). 

## Using your own data

If you chose your own data for this workshop, the data should meet these criteria:

* You should be familiar with the data, how it's formatted, and what the variables and values mean.

* The data should be geospatial and a vector format.

### Places to find data?

* [Geodata@Wisconsin](https://geodata.wisc.edu/)
* [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/)
* [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
